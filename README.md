# Work-Day-Planner


## Description
Created a simple calendar application for workday hours (between 9 AM and 5 PM) that allows a user to input their tasks for that time slot and save events for each hour of the day. Time slots in the past are displayed in gray, the current time slot is displayed in orange, and future time slots are displayed in green.
